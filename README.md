An SLE solver using the Cholesky decomposition for CSR matrices. The project contains a CSR matrix class with an .mtx-matrix loader and the solver itself working with CSR matrices. The project is to get a parallel implementation in the following updates. Also, it may be optimized using complex computational methods and technology.

Currently this repository only has the version made without parallelisation, while the parallel implementation is still being tested
